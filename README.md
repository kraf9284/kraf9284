## About Me
Hi, my name is Dylan Kraft and I am a Computer Science student at the University of St. Thomas! In addition to being interested in software engineering and problem solving, I am also very passionate about exploring my creativity and making art, which led me to become a Digital Media Art (DIMA) minor in addition to my major in CS. Through my DIMA minor and CS major combination, I ended up taking Creative Coding and Computer Graphics, which are both courses that allow for coding in addition to creative expression. Below are three projects I think best represent this interweaving of creativity and programming, in addition to what class/discipline it came from. Check out their respective repositories and those READEME's if you want to find out more about them!

## Projects
### Rainball
DIMA 298 | Creative Coding
<br>https://github.com/kraf9284/rainball
Final project for my Creative Coding class. I decided to make an endless scroll web game using WebGL, Three.js, some 3D models that I created on my own.

### GLSL Illumination Demo
CISC 420 | Computer Graphics
<br>https://github.com/kraf9284/cg-illumination
<br>The last assignment from my Computer Graphics course. We were tasked with completing the GLSL fragment and vertex shaders for two different kinds of lighting algorithms, and making 3D scenes to demonstrate the shaders.


### GLSL Fragment Shader Filter Demo
CISC 420 | Computer Graphics
<br>https://github.com/kraf9284/cg-fragmentshaders
<br>Take home portion of the final for Computer Graphics. Had to make multiple fragment shaders for different filters that would be applied to the video on the starter code and/or to your webcam footage.
